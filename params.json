{"name":"Long Beach","tagline":"A blogging engine with attention to attribution.","body":"Long Beach is a blogging engine I created to host my personal blog and website. The blogging engine is a little different than traditional blogs. It allows you credit authors and sources in link posts. For example, if you're posting a link to an article by Walt Mossberg at Re/code, you can add the link to his article and the attribution will appear as a part of the post. This additional attribution metadata also allows you to search the blog by author or source.\r\n\r\nThat said, this is also a traditional blogging engine. You can schedule posts or back-date posts. You can write in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) or pure HTML. The code will prompt you to automatically generate an updated sitemap after each post which you can link to in Google's Webmaster Tools.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to logos and your identity, drop in your logo and 2x retina logo which will look great on retina screens. There is also hooks for icons -- all kinds of icons -- that you will find useful.\r\n\r\n## Languages\r\nThis project uses the following languages/technologies:\r\n\r\n* PHP\r\n* MySQL\r\n* HTML\r\n* CSS\r\n* Javascript\r\n* Markdown\r\n* SmartyPants\r\n\r\n## Database\r\nThis project is configured to run off of a MySQL database. The SQL to create the necessary tables and data structures can be found in /SQL-setup.sql.\r\n\r\n## Edits Required\r\n\r\n### /admin/.htaccess\r\nYou will need to update the path to the .htpasswd file\r\n\r\n### /admin/.htpasswd\r\nAdd a username and hashed password to the .htpasswd file. I suggest you generate your username and password using this [htpasswd generator](http://aspirine.org/htpasswd_en.html).\r\n\r\n### /common/dbconnect.php\r\nUpdate the login information to your database. \r\n\r\n### /common/footer.php\r\nAdd your personal information and email address.\r\n\r\n### /common/google-analytics.php\r\nAdd your Google Analytics account ID.\r\n\r\n### Images\r\n* **/favicon.ico** -- Create and upload your own favicon.\r\n* **/images/icons/** -- Create icons for your site. The icons needed are referenced in /common/header-links.php\r\n* **/images/** -- Background image for top. I used MEK-Studios.png and MEK-Studios_2x.png. Both are referenced in /css/notional.css.\r\n\r\n### Removing references to MEK Studios\r\nMEK Studios is referenced throughout. You'll likely want to include your own website. This includes references to MEK Studios in text as well as URL references.\r\n\r\n### Text Files\r\nI included links to /about/ and /privacy/. Both of these pages are generated by /text.php which takes its cues from /.htaccess redirects and uses text files in/text/.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
